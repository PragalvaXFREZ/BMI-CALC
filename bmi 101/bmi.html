    <h1 class="intro"> INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <h3 class="q 1">What is Bmi?</h3>
    <h1 class="a">
      BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's calculated by dividing
      a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. BMI is commonly used as a screening tool
      to classify individuals into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, although it
      doesn't directly measure body fat percentage and doesn't account for factors like muscle mass or distribution of
      fat.
    </h1>
    <h3 class="q 2">Can BMI be influenced by factors other than body fat?</h3>
    <h1 class="a">
      Yes, BMI can be influenced by factors such as muscle mass, bone density, hydration status, and distribution of fat
      within the body. For example, athletes and individuals with high muscle mass may have a higher BMI despite being
      healthy and fit.
    </h1>
    <h3 class="q 2">Is BMI applicable for all age groups?</h3>
    <h1 class="a">
      BMI is primarily designed for adults and may not be suitable for assessing the weight status of children and
      adolescents. It is recommended that people younger than the age of 18 should not be calculating the BMI of
      themselves.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="intro"> <br>BMI SCORE</h1>
    <h3 class="q 2">What is the ideal bmi score?</h3>
    <h1 class="a">

      The ideal BMI score for adults is generally considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9, indicating a healthy weight
      range. However, BMI ranges vary : (click on the weight class to know more)

              Underweight BMI (below 18.5) indicates low body fat, potential health risks like nutrient deficiencies, weakened immunity, and other complications.</p>

              Overweight BMI (25.0 - 29.9) suggests excess body fat, increasing the risk of health problems like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <p class="info">Normal BMI (18.5 - 24.9) indicates a healthy weight range, reducing the risk of weight-related health issues and promoting overall well-being.</p>

      <h3 class="q 2">How does an individual's BMI score reflect their weight status, potential health risks, and overall well-being?</h3>
    <h1 class="a">
      An individual's BMI (Body Mass Index) score, calculated from their weight and height, provides a general indication of their weight status. A BMI below 18.5 suggests underweight, which may pose risks of nutrient deficiencies and weakened immunity. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, associated with lower health risks. BMIs between 25.0 and 29.9 indicate overweight, elevating the risk of conditions like heart disease and diabetes. A BMI of 30.0 or above suggests obesity, significantly increasing the risk of serious health problems. Extremely high BMIs (40.0 and above) denote extreme obesity, with severe health risks. However, BMI doesn't account for muscle mass or body composition, so other factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and overall health should also be considered for a comprehensive assessment of well-being.
